# 📘 Expense Tracker (React)

This is my first React application — a simple **Expense Tracker**. I built it after learning the core fundamentals of React: **components**, **props**, **state**, and **effects**.

The app allows users to add and track their expenses, with data stored in **localStorage** so their data will remain every time they open the app.
